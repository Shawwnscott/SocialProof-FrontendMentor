## My process

My process was first to best identify the proper semantic elements to use and then apply them to the content. After that i Then assigned class names to ever element, that way it was easier to work with. I then view the original content and decide to to do the layout, whether with CSS GRID or Flexbox. After having a rough idea i then get to the overall layout. After that it's fine tuning the spacing; margins, paddings, font size etc.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use percentages in my widths for a more fluid layout. I experimented with it so whether or not my approach it sustainable has yet to be determined.

### Continued development

Going forward I am trying to get better and more confident at using margins and paddings. Mainly understanding spacing.
